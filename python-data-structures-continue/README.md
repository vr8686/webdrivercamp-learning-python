## Special Notes

### Exercise 12
in this exercise I think this code will be better than the one with reduce()

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
def calc_weight(list_=[]):
    if not list_:
        return 0
    score_weight = sum(sc * we for sc, we in list_)
    weight = sum(i[1] for i in list_)
    return return score_weight / weight


if __name__ == "__main__":
    list_ = [(3, 2), (5, 9), (7, 7)]
    # = ((3 * 2) + (5 * 9) + (7 * 7)) / (2 + 4 + 9 + 7)
    result = calc_weight(list_)
    print(f"Weight: {result:0.2f}")
```

### filter function

Sorry, but I'm not sure in which exersice I should have used the filter() function...
